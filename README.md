# Joint Wallet - Decentralized joint bank account system built on the Ethereum blockchain

This project provides a smart contract that allows multiple users to create and manage a shared account on the Ethereum network. Each account can have up to four owners, all of whom must approve any withdrawal of funds. A basic frontend interface interacts with the smart contract, enabling users to import accounts into MetaMask, connect to the "Hardhat" network, and perform transactions and balance checks.
